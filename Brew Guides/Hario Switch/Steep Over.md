### Notes:  
**Result**: A very nice cup of coffee. Some of the subtle malt flavor of this bean is back, along with very very subtle acidity to brighten the brew and sweetness, which together are reading as mandarine orange, with a subtle chocolate finish. Really balanced, great mouthfeel and strength. This is one of the best brews I've made in a while.
