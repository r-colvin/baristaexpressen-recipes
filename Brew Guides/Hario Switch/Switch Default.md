**Dose**: 20g  
**Grind Size**:  
**Water**: 240g total  
**Water Temperature**:  
**Filter Papers**:  
**Ratio**: 1:12  

### Instructions: 
- Coffee First
- I added a slight bloom (15s) then poured in the rest of the water
- Steep 2 minutes, slight stir, release

### Notes:
**Result**: A really really good cup of coffee. I've been using a French press and this is just so much cleaner. Slight sour acidic (orange), slight sweet, with hints of chocolate and . . . coffee. LOL. Aftertaste subtly sweet, like a few grains of sugar in a glass of mountain water.
