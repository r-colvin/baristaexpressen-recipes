**Dose**: 15g  
**Grind Size**: Medium fine (11 on Timemore Chestnut Xlite)  
**Water**: 
**Water Temperature**:  
**Filter Papers**:   
**Ratio**: 1:16  

### Instructions: 
- Rinse filter
- add grounds, give a shake to settle ground flat
- switch open
- combined bloom and pour; pour slowly
- let drain completely
- close switch
- add 110ml more water
- steep 2 minutes
- release

### Notes:  
So we are taking advantage here of both the percolation and immersion abilities of the Switch. Starting with what is essentially a Tales Single Pour (without stirring the grounds first) and then steeping as in the default Switch recipe (all of which can be found above).

**Result**: A well-rounded cup of coffee. Balanced. As with the Pour-Over->Immersion (POI) above there is a dominant sweetness, with very subtle orange acidity. Aftertaste is mostly the sweetness. By design this recipe is far simpler than the POI. You will note I ground finer since the POI was a tad weak. This resulted in the exact strength and mouthfeel I think a cup of coffee should have, but that is very subjective. I kept the ratio the same so I wasn't putting too many new variables into play. If I were to change anything I'd go a little finer just to see what happens.
